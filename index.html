		<h1>Welcome to Old McDonald's Farm!</h1>

		<p>
		In this exercise we're going to create a digital representation of the McDonald family farm.
		</p>
		<strong>
			Requirements:
		</strong>

		<ol class="instructions-list">
			<li>
				Create programmatic representations of our barnyarn friends.  This structure is totally up to you.  
				Feel free to get creative and use the tools you have availableand any stategy you can think of.
			</li>

			<li>
				Create a "barnyard" programmatic representation.  This model should contain "pens" for the animals to live.
			</li>

			<li>
				Introduce a basic way of interacting with the animals in our barnyard.  
				For example,create a button on the page that would pet the animals which in turn would make a"noise", (in this case it would print something in the HTML).  
				<strong>Get creative here!</strong> I'd love to see the unique solutions you come up with!
			</li>
